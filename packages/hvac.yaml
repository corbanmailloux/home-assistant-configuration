## OLD STUFF BELOW


# The main thermostat is pulled in through both HomeKit and through the Honeywell Lyric cloud integration.
# Generally we use the HomeKit version for local control (climate.t9_thermostat), but that doesn't
# expose the options for setting and clearing holds. In those cases, use the cloud version (climate.hallway).

# The thermostat itself maintains the basic schedule. These automations override that schedule as needed.

# TODO: These are for the heating season only. Once the HVAC is replaced with a heat pump, update to work for both heating and cooling.
