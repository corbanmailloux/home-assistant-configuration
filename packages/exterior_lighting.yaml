# For all of the exterior/landscape lighting, turn on before sunset and off in the night.

# TODO Other things to consider:
# Do we want all of the exterior lighting on for the whole time, or just some?
# Motion already covers the bright driveway light, but we could also have the rest of the exterior lighting come on/brighten as we're approaching home.
# If we're hosting a party, we may want the lighting on later than 11pm. Could/should I tie the exterior lighting together to function on one switch instead of 3+?
