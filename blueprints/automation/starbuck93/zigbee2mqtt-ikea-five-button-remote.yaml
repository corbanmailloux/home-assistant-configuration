  name: Z2M - IKEA five button remote for lights and actions
  description: 'Control lights with an IKEA five button remote (the round ones).


    The middle "on" button, toggle the lights on/off to the last set brightness

    (unless the force brightness is toggled on in the blueprint).


    Dim up/down buttons will change the brightness smoothly and can be pressed

    and hold until the brightness is satisfactory.


    The "left" and "right" buttons can be assigned to a short and long button

    press action. This allows you to assign, e.g., a scene or anything else.
