## Corban Mailloux's Home Assistant Configuration

This is the configuration I use for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). I use [Hass.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/) running on a Raspberry Pi as the central Home Assistant server.

Here are (some of) the services/platforms/other devices that I use with Home Assistant:

### Helper Templates

#### List all `entity_id`s
During the update to v0.85 of Home Assistant, `slugify` changed. I was nervous this would cause subtle changes in my `entity_id` values and I wouldn't notice, so I exported them all before and after the update.
I could have also grabbed this from the "States" page in HASS, but I wanted it as a template.
```
{% for state in states -%}
  {{ state.entity_id }}
{% endfor %}
```
